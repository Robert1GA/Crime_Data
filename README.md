<h1>FAQ / Info</h1>
<p>Q: What is this page?</p>
<p>A: This page presents a visual representation on where homicides took place within the city limits of Chicago.</p>

<p>Q: Why did you make it?</p>
<p>A: In 2016, the Chicago homicide rate was the highest it has been in the last 20 years. The current total (which may still be updated) was 746. I thought it would be useful to show the locations that each one took place using the data from the City of Chicago public data.</p>

<p>Q: How did you come to getting this data?<p>
<p>A: It is readily available on Chicago's government website.  They offer the data in an <a href="http://api1.chicagopolice.org/clearpath/documentation">API</a> and it is also viewable in table format here: <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2016/kf95-mnd6">https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2016/kf95-mnd6</a>, along with all other crime statistics.

<p>Q: Do you live in Chicago?</p>
<p>A: No. I'm just a former resident and currently concerned citizen.</p>

<p>Q: Anything else to know?<p>
<p>A: Yes, I do plan to further populate the map with more crime data, other than just homicides.</p>
